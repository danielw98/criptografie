# Cryptography Application with GUI

A graphical user interface application made in Python using the Tkinter library for encoding messages with Caesar's Cipher and the Polybius Square Cipher.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Select the corresponding key using the "<<" and ">>" arrows.

- **Polybius Square Cipher**: Enter the key and press the "OK" button.

# Task Solution

- Choose the desired mode (Encryption/Decryption).

- Enter the path to the desired input file (Browse).

- Save the new file (Save).

# Options
